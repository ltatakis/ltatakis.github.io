<p>Hello!👋
I am Lefteris! A software engineer commited to solving problems and always up for a challenge.
</p>
<p>
I am a highly motivated and entrepreneurial individual, who is eager to learn and interested in problem-solving, ready to take on any challenge.
</p>
<p>
As an undergraduate, I launched my own e-commerce company - Cretecompare - a car rental comparison website for the island of Crete, in which I collaborated with a number of local companies.
Whilst this project was short-lived, it provided me with a strong foundation in designing and implementing business applications, and it has been an invaluable lesson for acquiring technical and business acumen. 
</p>

<p>
Currently I am working at Elsevier as a
