description: Week 3 - the bike fit
---

This week's highlight is the initial fitting of my Aero bars! As always, when it comes to bike fit, I go to [sportstechlab](https://www.sportstechlab.com/) to discuss what my goals are and how I want to do this.
Given my current experience with aero bars ( 0 ) and flexibility ( not the best ) we decided to use aerobars as just a variation to place my body / hands during the long rides.
I shouldn't be aiming to be saving X amount of Watts due to this position, but to be able to just add variety to my body position during long rides.
If I can just stay on the aerobars for 20% of the race that would be a huge benefit for my performance.

However, to achieve this __its going to be a journey__. With multiple visits to Bryan to change and adjust my bike fit.


My flexibility and comfort over the next 2-3 months needs to significantly improve if I am to consider this bike position for race day. And I can assure you that needs a lot of work ... 😳

For example, currently my nature body position on the aerobars is:

However, it has to become like this:

That means my low back and hip muscles needs to strengthen and not be a tight!
Which as anything in this journey is easier said that done! 😅


Added to all this, today I did 1:55min on the turbo ... pfff... not so much fun.. after a certain point I need to start watching videos rather  than focusing on Zwift because my mind just can't take it! 
This is something I will have to work on, but that probably means more time on the turbo 🙈
But what I would like to do when its less cold and likely to have ice on the road, to just do the training outside. Sitting on the turbo for 2-3 hours is just mental torture!
