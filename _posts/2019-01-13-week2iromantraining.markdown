My main focus for these early months is the cycling, my key weakness. I would like to try and start enjoying the session as much as this:

It _might_ happen 😂 but we shall see... 😅 

The highlight of this week was my first "long" session on the turbo, 
1hour 35 min 😳 I am not sure how people do it... its not confortable!

In order to finish the session, I had to distract myself with Youtube videos to get past the pain of the last 10 min!
Looking at the Zwift Grand Fondo program I am doing its only going up! With sessions over 3 hours on a turbo! 😱 

The sessions this week were:
 - Monday morning swim
 - Wednesday double cycling session. Was not planned, but as I was prepping for the Oxford Tri swim I found out the boiler was broken down at the pool! The Lead Coach joked about using wetsuits in the pool, as it was 25C. Personally did not fancy a cold pool on a January evening 😅 And did a bike session instead!
 - Sunday 1:35 on Zwift and 5km run.
