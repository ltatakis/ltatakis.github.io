Its going to be a big year for me, its the year I am going to become an Ironman.
You will notice that I am _confident_ about it. Well ... lets say we shall see what happens, but:

<p align="center">
Failure is not an option!
</p>
I have focused on starting the new year running, (or more like cycling) by doing all the key sessions I should be doing over the next few months.
1. Cycling sessions. I started doing my Zwift Grand Fonto training program, which aims to build my fitness to be ready to do 100-200km.
2. Early morning swims, at 6:30. I am currently, trying to get my body used to that effort. These sessions should be easy (eventually), active recovery for 40-50 minutes. (Going to do one tomorrow 😅)
3. Brick sessions. I "kinda" did one on Monday but I rested in between the sessions... So... maybe it was just two sessions, which luckily is something I need to do also! 
4. Enjoyed my life a bit! 😇

The top three items all had there challenges. For example, the Zwift program was quite demanding and I am only on Week 0 ( 😳 ), the swim was at 6:30 am (enough said) and the brick was the first "long" ride I had dont since probably September.

So far, so good! 

A *lot* more hard work to come, but dare I say ( 🤞🏻 ) I am ready for it!
